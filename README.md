# Predictive-Maintenance-System

#### **1. Define System Requirements & Scope**
Before diving into the code, it's essential to define the basic requirements of the predictive maintenance system.
- **Use Case**: Determine which type of equipment or vehicles you'll be monitoring. 
- **Key Metrics to Monitor**: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as temperature, vibration, motor performance, fuel consumption, etc.
- **Prediction Goal**: Predict failure or maintenance needs based on historical data or real-time sensor data.

#### **2. Design Database Schema (MySQL)**
You need to design a schema for storing the historical data and sensor information.
- **Entities to Model**:
  - **Equipment/Vehicles**: Each machine or vehicle needs to be represented.
  - **Sensors**: Store sensor readings (e.g., temperature, vibration, etc.).
  - **Maintenance Logs**: Store maintenance records for historical analysis.
  - **Predictions**: Store predicted maintenance needs or failures.
  
  Example schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE equipment (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    type VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE sensors (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    equipment_id INT,
    type VARCHAR(50),  -- e.g., Temperature, Vibration
    value FLOAT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (equipment_id) REFERENCES equipment(id)
);

CREATE TABLE maintenance_logs (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    equipment_id INT,
    date TIMESTAMP,
    description TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (equipment_id) REFERENCES equipment(id)
);

CREATE TABLE predictions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    equipment_id INT,
    predicted_failure_date TIMESTAMP,
    failure_probability FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (equipment_id) REFERENCES equipment(id)
);
```

#### **3. Set Up Your Development Environment**
- Install **Go**, **Fiber**, **MySQL**, and **GORM**.
- Create a Go project structure.

**Install required dependencies:**
```bash
go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
go get github.com/jinzhu/gorm
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

- **Folder structure**:
```
/predictive-maintenance
    /cmd
        main.go
    /models
        equipment.go
        sensor.go
        maintenance.go
        prediction.go
    /routes
        api.go
    /services
        prediction_service.go
```

#### **4. Create Models in Go (Using GORM)**
Create models for **Equipment**, **Sensors**, **Maintenance Logs**, and **Predictions**. These models map to the tables in your MySQL database.

```go
// models/equipment.go
package models

import (
	"time"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

type Equipment struct {
	ID        uint           `gorm:"primaryKey"`
	Name      string         `gorm:"not null"`
	Type      string         `gorm:"not null"`
	CreatedAt time.Time      `gorm:"default:CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"`
}

type Sensor struct {
	ID         uint      `gorm:"primaryKey"`
	EquipmentID uint     `gorm:"not null"`
	Type       string    `gorm:"not null"`
	Value      float64   `gorm:"not null"`
	Timestamp  time.Time `gorm:"default:CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"`
}

type MaintenanceLog struct {
	ID          uint      `gorm:"primaryKey"`
	EquipmentID uint      `gorm:"not null"`
	Date        time.Time `gorm:"default:CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"`
	Description string    `gorm:"not null"`
}

type Prediction struct {
	ID                uint      `gorm:"primaryKey"`
	EquipmentID       uint      `gorm:"not null"`
	PredictedFailureDate time.Time `gorm:"not null"`
	FailureProbability float64   `gorm:"not null"`
	CreatedAt         time.Time `gorm:"default:CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"`
}
```

#### **5. Set Up Fiber Routes (API Endpoints)**
Create API routes for interacting with the system:
- Add equipment
- Add sensor data
- Add maintenance logs
- Get equipment sensor data
- Fetch predictions

```go
// routes/api.go
package routes

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"predictive-maintenance/models"
	"predictive-maintenance/services"
)

func SetupRoutes(app *fiber.App) {
	app.Post("/equipment", services.CreateEquipment)
	app.Post("/sensors", services.AddSensorData)
	app.Post("/maintenance", services.AddMaintenanceLog)
	app.Get("/equipment/:id", services.GetEquipmentData)
	app.Get("/predictions/:id", services.GetPredictions)
}
```

#### **6. Data Collection (Simulate Sensor Data Input)**
You can simulate sensor data collection. If you’re integrating with actual sensors (e.g., IoT devices), this would be replaced with real-time data collection.

For simplicity, you can mock data input:

```go
// services/prediction_service.go
package services

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"predictive-maintenance/models"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

// Simulate adding sensor data (e.g., temperature)
func AddSensorData(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
	var sensor models.Sensor
	if err := c.BodyParser(&sensor); err != nil {
		return c.Status(400).JSON(fiber.Map{"error": "Invalid input"})
	}
	
	// Simulate sensor value
	sensor.Value = rand.Float64() * 100  // Example sensor value for temperature
	sensor.Timestamp = time.Now()

	// Save to database
	if err := db.Create(&sensor).Error; err != nil {
		return c.Status(500).JSON(fiber.Map{"error": "Failed to save data"})
	}
	return c.Status(201).JSON(sensor)
}
```

#### **7. Predictive Analytics (Machine Learning or Statistical Models)**
The core of predictive maintenance is **predicting failures** based on historical data. You can use basic statistical methods like **moving averages**, or even simple **machine learning models** (e.g., regression or classification) for failure predictions. Here’s a high-level structure:

- **Modeling failure probabilities**: Use a supervised model (e.g., logistic regression) or time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA).
- You can use **Go-based ML libraries** like [Gonum](https://gonum.org/) or integrate with **Python** (using a Go-Python bridge like [go-python3](https://github.com/go-python3/gopy)) for more sophisticated models.

Example of a simple predictive function using a basic algorithm:

```go
func PredictMaintenance(equipmentId uint) (*models.Prediction, error) {
	// Collect historical sensor data from database for the specific equipment
	var sensors []models.Sensor
	if err := db.Where("equipment_id = ?", equipmentId).Find(&sensors).Error; err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// Perform simple analysis (e.g., mean temperature for now)
	var sum float64
	for _, sensor := range sensors {
		sum += sensor.Value
	}

	meanValue := sum / float64(len(sensors))

	// Predict failure probability (e.g., if average temp > threshold, failure likely)
	probability := 0.0
	if meanValue > 70.0 { // Threshold for temperature-based failure prediction
		probability = 0.8
	}

	// Create a prediction record
	prediction := models.Prediction{
		EquipmentID:       equipmentId,
		PredictedFailureDate: time.Now().Add(30 * time.Hour),  // Example: predict failure in 30 hours
		FailureProbability: probability,
	}

	db.Create(&prediction)

	return &prediction, nil
}
```

The current implementation of your `PredictMaintenance` function uses a simple approach to predict maintenance or failure probability based on the **mean value** of sensor data (e.g., temperature, or other values that sensors might record). Here’s an overview of how the prediction works:

### 1. **Data Collection (Historical Sensor Data)**
   - The function first collects historical sensor data for a specific `equipmentId` from the database.
   - It queries the `Sensor` table using the `equipmentId` and fetches all related sensor records.

   ```go
   var sensors []models.Sensor
   if err := db.DB.Where("equipment_id = ?", equipmentId).Find(&sensors).Error; err != nil {
       return nil, err
   }
   ```

### 2. **Simple Analysis (Mean Calculation)**
   - The function calculates the **mean** (average) value of all the sensor readings for that equipment. The assumption here is that the sensors record a value that can be averaged (for example, temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.).
   
   ```go
   var sum float64
   for _, sensor := range sensors {
       sum += sensor.Value
   }

   meanValue := sum / float64(len(sensors))
   ```

   - The `meanValue` represents the average reading from all sensors associated with that equipment.

### 3. **Failure Prediction (Based on Threshold)**
   - The function predicts the likelihood of failure based on the `meanValue` of the sensor readings. For simplicity, a threshold value of `70.0` is used:
     - If the mean value of the sensor readings is greater than `70.0`, it assumes that the equipment is at a higher risk of failure, so the failure probability is set to `0.8` (i.e., 80% probability of failure).
     - If the mean value is below or equal to `70.0`, the failure probability is set to `0.0` (no predicted failure).

   ```go
   probability := 0.0
   if meanValue > 70.0 { // Threshold for temperature-based failure prediction
       probability = 0.8
   }
   ```

   This approach is simplistic because it relies on just one threshold value (`70.0`). In a real-world scenario, you'd want a more sophisticated model that takes into account:
   - Sensor type (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure)
   - Equipment-specific failure patterns
   - Historical failure data (machine learning models)
   - Trends over time, and much more.

### 4. **Prediction Record Creation**
   - Once the failure probability is determined, the function creates a prediction record (`models.Prediction`) with the following data:
     - `EquipmentID`: The ID of the equipment being analyzed.
     - `PredictedFailureDate`: The predicted failure date. In this case, it is set to 30 hours from the current time.
     - `FailureProbability`: The failure probability calculated earlier (either `0.0` or `0.8`).

   ```go
   prediction := models.Prediction{
       EquipmentID:          equipmentId,
       PredictedFailureDate: time.Now().Add(30 * time.Hour), // Predict failure in 30 hours
       FailureProbability:   probability,
   }
   ```

   - This prediction record is saved in the database using `db.DB.Create(&prediction)`.

### 5. **Return the Prediction**
   - Finally, the function returns the created prediction record (`prediction`) to the caller, along with any errors encountered during the process.

   ```go
   return &prediction, nil
   ```

### **How It Predicts Maintenance**
- **Simple Thresholding:** The failure prediction here is based on a simple threshold-based approach:
  - The equipment is predicted to fail (80% probability) if the average sensor reading exceeds a predefined threshold (`70.0` in this case).
  - If the sensor reading is below the threshold, it predicts no failure (0% probability).
  
  This approach doesn't involve complex modeling (like machine learning), but it uses a rule of thumb (threshold) to determine failure probability based on past sensor data.

### **Limitations of the Current Prediction**
- **Over-Simplification:** The current approach is quite simple and uses only one threshold. In reality, you'd likely want to predict failure based on multiple factors, such as:
  - Trends in sensor data over time (e.g., increasing temperature or vibrations).
  - Anomalies or patterns in sensor data (machine learning could help here).
  - Equipment type and specific characteristics.
  
- **No Trend Analysis:** Right now, you’re using a single snapshot (mean of current sensor values), but failure prediction would be much more accurate if you considered how values are changing over time (e.g., increasing temperature or vibrations).

- **Data-Driven Predictions:** You can enhance the prediction by implementing predictive models like:
  - **Time-series forecasting** to predict failure based on historical trends.
  - **Anomaly detection** algorithms to spot unusual behavior in sensor data.

### **Next Steps for Better Predictions**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Filter the sensors based on type, date range, etc.
- **Machine Learning:** Train a machine learning model on historical sensor data to learn the patterns leading up to failure.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Use statistical methods like regression or time-series analysis to better predict failure probabilities.
- **Multiple Sensors:** Consider how multiple sensor values (e.g., temperature, vibration) affect failure, rather than just one sensor type.

This simple prediction model is just a starting point, and it can be significantly improved with more data and advanced techniques.

#### **8. Test and Refine Predictive Models**
- Test your predictive model with historical data to check its accuracy.
- Refine the model to improve prediction accuracy, potentially adding more complex features, such as environmental factors or combining multiple sensors.

#### **9. Implement Real-time Data Streaming (Optional)**
For more advanced systems, consider implementing **real-time data processing** using tools like **Apache Kafka** or **NATS** to stream data from IoT sensors in real time.

#### **10. Build the Frontend (Optional)**
While the backend is key, you can also build a simple frontend (e.g., using **React** or **Vue.js**) to visualize:
- Current sensor data
- Equipment status
- Maintenance predictions
